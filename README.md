This project focused on developing a user-friendly web-based tool for presenting the previously implemented tree
distance metrics. The project also examined how tree distance metrics could be used to address problems both in and outside the field of biology.

The code included in this project is for reference purposes only. The complete code is property of the Aarhus University and not available for release.

Two primary experiments were run through the tool.

1. Compare the structures of RNA 
2. Assess how well the public performed on the Great Language Game. 


1. RNA Structures 


2. Language Trees
